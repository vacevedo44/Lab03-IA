# Badass Superheroes 

## Scarlet Witch 
Scarlet Witch is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in *The X-Men #4* (March 1964) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. She is first portrayed as a supervillain along with her twin brother Quicksilver as a founding member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. Scarlet Witch is later depicted as a regular member of the Avengers superhero team. She also becomes the wife of fellow superhero and teammate Vision, with whom she has two sons, Thomas and William.

### Powers 
In most depictions she is portrayed as a mutant, a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with superhuman abilities, and, for much of the character's history, was considered the daughter of the mutant Magneto. Scarlet Witch possesses abilities to alter reality in unspecified ways and is a powerful sorceress.

### Backstory
The character's in-universe backstory and parentage has been changed more than once. Depicted in the 1970s as the children of golden age superhero Whizzer, a retcon in the 1980s revealed Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver to be the unknown offspring of supervillain Magneto. Born to Magneto's estranged wife in Transia, Scarlet Witch and her brother are left in the care of their adoptive Romani parents and she is raised as Wanda Maximoff (later referred to as Wanda Frank while the Whizzer was considered to be her father). In another retcon in the 2010s, it is revealed that Quicksilver and she are not mutants but were kidnapped and used as subjects of genetic experimentation by the High Evolutionary, then misled to believe Magneto was their father.

### MCU 
Along with starring in two self-titled limited series of her own, the character appears in animated films, television series, arcade and video games as well as other Marvel-related merchandise. Scarlet Witch is portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen in the films Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019) from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Elizabeth Olsen will reprise the role in the upcoming Disney+ series WandaVision (2021) and the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2021).

## Gamora 
Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer/artist Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in *Strange Tales #180* (June 1975). 

### Powers 
Her powers include superhuman strength and agility and an accelerated healing factor. She also is an elite combatant, being able to beat most of the opponents in the galaxy.

### Backstory
Gamora is the adopted daughter of Thanos, and the last of her species. She is a member of the group known as the Infinity Watch. The character played a role in the 2007 crossover comic book event *"Annihilation: Conquest"*, and became a member of the titular team in its spin-off comic, *Guardians of the Galaxy*.

### MCU
Gamora has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise. Zoe Saldana plays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014), *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017), *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).

## Rogue 
Rogue is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character debuted in *Avengers Annua* #10 (1981) as a villain, but she joined the X-Men soon thereafter.

### Powers
Rogue is part of a subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. Rogue has the involuntary ability to absorb and sometimes also remove the memories, physical strength, and superpowers of anyone she touches. Therefore, Rogue considers her powers to be a curse. Due to her skin producing involuntary high-voltage jolts, for most of her life she limited her physical contact with others, including her on-off love interest and eventual husband, Gambit. However, after many years, Rogue finally gained full control over her mutant ability.

### Backstory 
Hailing from the fictional Caldecott County, Mississippi, Rogue is the X-Men's self-described southern belle. A runaway, she was adopted by Mystique of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and grew up as a villain. After Rogue permanently absorbs Ms. Marvel's psyche and Kree powers, she reforms and turns to the X-Men, fearing for her sanity. Rogue's real name and early history were not revealed until nearly 20 years after her introduction. Until the back story provided by Robert Rodi in the ongoing Rogue series, which began in September 2004, Rogue's background was only hinted at. Her name was revealed as Anna Marie, although her surname is still unknown. She has sometimes adopted the name Raven, which is the first name of her foster mother, Mystique.

### MCU
Rogue has been featured in most of the X-Men animated series, and various video games. In the X-Men film series, she was portrayed by Anna Paquin. Her visual cue is often the white streak that runs through her hair and her gloves.
